                At <strong>Shortly</strong>, we take the security of your data seriously. We implement best practices to
                protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">1. Data Encryption</h2>
            <p>All data transmitted to and from our platform is encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure
                communication between your device and our servers.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2. Secure Storage</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored in secure databases protected by access controls, encryption at rest, and regular
                backups
                to prevent data loss or breach.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">3. Account Protection</h2>
            <p>We recommend choosing a strong password and keeping it confidential. Avoid using the same password across
                multiple platforms.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">4. Internal Security</h2>
            <p>Only authorized team members have access to system infrastructure and user data, and all access is logged
                and
                monitored.</p>
